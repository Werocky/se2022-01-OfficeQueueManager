## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 3 stories committed vs. 2 stories done 
- Total of 9 points committed vs. 6 points done done 
- 48 of hours planned (8 for each team member) vs. XXXXXXXX hours spent (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _User-Select the service type_    |   _4_   |  _3_   |   _3d_     |              |
| _Officer-Call next client_    |   _5_   | _3_    |    _1d_   |              |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?  
In many cases, we took longer than expected to solve tasks. Initially we had to quickly review the use of javascript and react and the testing part. Then we had some database management issues that we had to fix in order to continue. Also 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?  
We learned that working together can be really useful, in particular working in pairs to divide the work and test the parts implemented by the other person. But with the division of tasks we did, there were times when one person's work depended on what needed to be done by another; this made us slow down.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)  
Improve subdivision of tasks
Better management of time related to testing
More meeting in order to talk and understand where the problems of each of us are

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
